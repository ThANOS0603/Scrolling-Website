            Anything below this is just to fill the paragraph. Kratos, the protagonist of the "God of War" video game series, is a former Spartan general who becomes disillusioned with the gods after they trick him into murdering his own family. His appearance is striking, with pale skin, red markings, and a scar across his right eye. Known for his intense rage, he later shows moments of compassion and introspection. Kratos wields powerful weapons like the Blades of Chaos and the Leviathan Axe, and possesses superhuman strength and agility. Throughout the series, he embarks on epic quests, battling gods, titans, and mythical creatures. His motivations evolve from seeking revenge to seeking redemption and protecting his son, Atreus, in later installments. In the 2018 installment, he undergoes significant character growth, confronting his past and learning to be a better father.<br></br>
            Atreus, a figure in Greek mythology, is a significant character in the story of the House of Atreus, which is marked by a series of tragic events. He is the son of King Agamemnon and Queen Clytemnestra. Atreus plays a central role in the saga due to the curse on his family, stemming from the actions of his ancestors, Tantalus and Pelops. The curse leads to a cycle of violence and betrayal within the family. Atreus himself becomes known for his revenge against his brother Thyestes, which involves a gruesome act of serving Thyestes his own children for dinner. This act sets the stage for further tragedy within the family. Atreus's story is a classic example of the themes of fate, revenge, and the consequences of one's actions in Greek mythology.
